        <div class="intro">
            <p>I am from Los Angeles, California. I was a retail manager and I worked construction before that. After graduating from high school I attended college but I never really figured out what I wanted to have a career in so I focused on work. Luckily I pushed into taking a one time coding class and I was hooked!</p>

        <div class="aboutme">
            <p>I have really loved my journey with coding so far. I like solving problems and learning how things work so working with functions is great. I also like linking the CSS part because because of the creativity that can be done with it. I am used to working with other people because of my previous jobs. I do enjoy working with others because we can bounce ideas off of each other or they might be have a more efficient way of doing things. It also helps build connections and can open doors in the future.</p>

            <p>Other than coding I enjoy doing other hobbies like:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>photography which I believe helps with the creativity when writing CSS</li>
                <li>fixing things around the house after breaking them a little bit more like debugging</li>
                <li>I also like to play soccer which helps with being a team player</li>
            </ol>
